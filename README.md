# graph-immunology-thesis
Reproducible code for my PhD thesis on graph deep learning for computational immunology: PyTorch/DGL implementations for graph neural models in computational immunology: HLA–peptide interaction modelling, dual-hypergraph learning, contrastive pretraining, generative graph augmentation, XAI-based bias analysis and capsule network.
This repository contains the reference implementation and reproduction scripts for the experiments presented in my PhD thesis on graph-based deep learning for computational immunology. It includes PyTorch and DGL code for modelling HLA–peptide interactions, interaction-aware graph and hypergraph formulations, self-supervised contrastive learning with generative graph augmentation, and explainability-driven bias identification and evaluation. The repository provides configuration files, training and evaluation pipelines, and instructions to reproduce the main results reported in the thesis.
