IDGL Impact Analysis:
  Key Observations:
  - Peptide-HLA interactions: -604 change (-90.7%)
  - Community structure: +11 communities
  - Average edge weight: -11.5% change

  Top 5 strongest connections in learned graph:
    Peptide node 0 - Peptide node 0: weight = 1.000
    Peptide node 0 - Peptide node 1: weight = 1.000
    Peptide node 0 - Peptide node 8: weight = 1.000
    Peptide node 0 - HLA node 35: weight = 1.000
    Peptide node 0 - HLA node 47: weight = 1.000

Conclusion:
  IDGL has refined the graph structure by removing less relevant connections,
  focusing on the most important peptide-HLA interactions.
