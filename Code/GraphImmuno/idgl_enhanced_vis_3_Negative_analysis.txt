IDGL Impact Analysis:
  Key Observations:
  - Peptide-HLA interactions: -554 change (-83.2%)
  - Community structure: +9 communities
  - Average edge weight: -19.0% change

  Top 5 strongest connections in learned graph:
    Peptide node 1 - Peptide node 1: weight = 1.000
    Peptide node 1 - Peptide node 3: weight = 1.000
    Peptide node 3 - Peptide node 3: weight = 1.000
    Peptide node 7 - Peptide node 7: weight = 1.000
    Peptide node 7 - Peptide node 15: weight = 1.000

Conclusion:
  IDGL has refined the graph structure by removing less relevant connections,
  focusing on the most important peptide-HLA interactions.
